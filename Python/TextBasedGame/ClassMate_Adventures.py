### Name - David Bravo
### Date - 7/21/2025
### Program Description - A small text adventure about a person stuck in a strange testing facility. It's small, but there's 7 endings to get.
### P.S. I wanted to make this way longer and much more intuitive, but the original project got corrupted 2 days ago, so I lost everything.

### Import system
import sys

### Import pygame
import pygame

### Import fore, back, & style from colorama

### Import random

### Ask for the player's name
max_attempts = 3 # Set max attempts to enter Arkadi Petrov's name.

### Print the intro message
