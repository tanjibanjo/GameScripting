Guessing Game Pseudocode
Variables:
	correcNumber = nil
	userGuess = nil
	attempts = 0
	continue = true
	playAgain = true;
	userChoice = nil;
	
Algorithm:
	1. While (playAgain ~= false) --player wants to continue playing
	2. use random generator to choose a random number in between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
	3. while (attempts < 7 or continue == false) --max attempts are 7, so this will fire seven times, or until user guesses correctly
		a. prompt user to enter a number guess and store in userGuess
		b. check if the guess is the same as the correct number
			i. if it is, set continue = false
			ii. else, increment the attempts ++
		c. reset the userGuess variable to nil
	4. check the status of continue
		a. if continue == false, the user has won the game 
			i. print win message
		b. if continue == true, the loop ended when the player guessed 7 times
			ii. print lose message
	5. prompt user if they want to play again and store in userChoice [y/n]
		a. if userChoice ~= 'y' or 'n', prompt until it does
		b. if userChoice == 'n'
			i. playAgain = false;
